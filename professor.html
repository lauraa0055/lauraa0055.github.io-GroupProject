                            the textbook. Some Important points to remember: 
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Assignment solutions must be legible: Difficult-to-read solutions may be marked off or may not graded entirely.</li>
                            <li>Typed assignments are required. Use either MS word, Google Docs, or Libre Office suite to type your assignment.</li>
                            <li>No late assignments accepted</li>
                        </ul>

                            Students arriving after class has begun will recieve half credit for attendance that day. This
                            rule does not apply to absences due to religious observances, as described in the Undergraduate Bulletin.
